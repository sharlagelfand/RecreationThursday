Alfredo Hlito, Curves and Straight Lines (1948). 

An oil painting of colorful geometric lines on a cream background. Starting at the top of the painting in the middle there is a dark yellow curve. Intersecting it in the center of the painting is a black line at a 45 degree angle and a dark blue curve. In the top right of the center area there are short horizontal black blue green and red lines. In the top left of the center area are horizontal green red blue and black lines. In the bottom left of the center there is a short horizontal red line.

To us, the placement of these lines conveys a sense of balance and free movement. This in the spirit of Hlito's placement in art history, as one who rejected figurativism  and celebrated abstraction and geometry.
