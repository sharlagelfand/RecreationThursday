Sol Lewitt, Color Bands (2000); Alt Text:

A set of eight square panels arranged evenly in two rows. Each panel contains randomized series of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple lines or curves, uniform in size and direction. All sets of lines are either horizontal, vertical, or at a 45Â° angle, and curves are concentric, usually forming concentric circles centered around a corner of the panel. Panels are separated into subsections, between which the direction of lines changes, or the center point of concentric circles changes.
