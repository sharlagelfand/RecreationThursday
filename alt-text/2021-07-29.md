Anton Stankowkski, Quadratspirale schwarz, 1952

This is a silkscreen print of multiple squares with a thick black border. The fill of each square is the same color as the piece's off-white background. Starting from the center of the print, the squares start to form a spiral traveling counterclockwise. As the spiral grows, the squares decrease in size.
