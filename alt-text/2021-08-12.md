Bridget Riley's Hesitate (1964)

Hesitate is a painting on a rectangular board the features even rows of circular and elliptical shapes. The top row is composed of circles, giving way to subsequent rows of increasingly flat ovals, before expanding back into rows of circles in the lower half of the painting. The slimmest ovals, situated a third of the way down the work, form a compressed band three rows deep. The shapes are painted in grey tones, beginning in a pale silvery shade in the top left corner of the work. The grey darkens with each row along a diagonal axis to become almost black, before fading back to pale silver and then darkening once again in the bottom right hand corner of the painting. This combination of shifting tone and changing shapes gives the viewer the impression of motion in the painting, as if two horizontal abutting cylinders are receding into the painting, or as if a wave is oscillating across its surface.
