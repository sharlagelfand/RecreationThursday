From the White Rabbit collection: "Grandmother's Clothes 1 (2008) depicts the front of a silky shirt, patterned in maroon and white. The artist [Chung Shun-Wen] has carefully painted details such as the seams around the breast pockets, and the tiny stitches around its button holes." The pattern has small, yellow and white diamonds dotted within wavy, white and maroon stripes. The painting looks very much like a close up of old and weathered material.
