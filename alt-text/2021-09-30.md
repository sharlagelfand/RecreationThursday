Design for wrapping paper: De Bijenkorf (1933) is a rectangular design pattern that is ink stamped on laid paper using carved woodcut block. The title has the meaning of "the beehives" in Dutch. This 11 letter sequence is broken up into 2 consecutive letter intervals, which are used as one of many tiles that make up the output that resembles a grid. Each tile either spells a 2 letter sequence, or draws a semi circle. The background colour alternates between black and ivory, while the letters or semi circles are coloured with the opposite, and are rotated randomly in 90 degree intervals.
