"Grid" is a cyanotype print of nine white squares arranged in a three by three grid on a deep blue background. The four corner squares each have a gradient from deep blue to the white, but only on the sides of the squares that match their position. For example, the top right square’s top and right sides go from blue on the outside to white on the inside, but the left and bottom sides are completely white. The other squares around the perimeter each have a gradient on all sides except their innermost side - the right perimeter square has a gradient from blue to white on all sides except the left. The center square has a gradient on all four sides. The result is an optical illusion, where the center square looks farther away and as if it’s pulling the rest of the squares in.
