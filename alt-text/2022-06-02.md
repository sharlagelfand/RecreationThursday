die grafischen Reihen by Max Bill is a series of overlaid and brightly colored polygons, starting with an octagon and decreasing by one side per layer until reaching a final triangle layer on top. The polygons are colored purple, orange, blue, green, red, and yellow, going from the base octogon to top-layer triangle, respectively. The piece is set on top of an off-white square canvas surrounded by a thick black trim. There is minimal typography surrounding the piece, with the artist's name in the upper-left, the title in the upper-right, and the publisher, verlag gerd hatje, in small type in the center-bottom.
